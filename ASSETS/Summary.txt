I am a PhD candidate in Electrical and Computing Engineering at New York University - Polytechnic School of Engineering, expected to graduate in 2024. I have a Master of Engineering in Systems Engineering from Cornell University and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Indiana University Bloomington. My core competencies include programming, optimization, simulation, and embedded systems.</br></br>

I have over two years of experience as a Military Science Researcher at Korea Army Consolidated Supply Depot, where I researched and developed a storage optimization webpage using Java, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. I also used a genetic algorithm to optimize warehouse storage and published a research paper in the Korea Military Science Journal. Additionally, I have over a year of experience as a Research Assistant at Cornell University College of Engineering, where I worked on two projects related to transit routing and autonomous driving. I developed a system for optical routing for small-area transit, such as buses or robots, and software for the Lidar sensor. I also developed a Lidar real-time communication program for multiple devices like Raspberry Pi and MCUs. I am passionate about applying my skills and knowledge to solve real-world problems and create innovative solutions. I am eager to learn from and collaborate with diverse and talented teams and contribute to advancing science and technology.
